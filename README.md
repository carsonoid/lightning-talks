## Running these presentations

These presentation uses a custom theme and can be run by installing the [`go-present`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/present) tool and starting it:

It also does some setup work to fake out the go env to enable "commands" to exec in the presentation against the local machine.

Run it with the run script

```bash
./run
```
